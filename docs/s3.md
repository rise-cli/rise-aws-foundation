# s3

## Introduction

Working with files is a common requirement for apps. If the thing you are working with
can be represented as a JSON object, this is not the service to use (although, sometimes poeple will dump GB of data
into s3 for analytics, usually in the form of a zip file). If your data can be represented as
an object, DynamoDB is the service for you. If not, then S3 is a good service to consider.

Files represent any binary file
such as:

-   zip files containing lambda source code
-   pictures
-   audio files
-   video files
-   any file that cannot be represented as a JSON object

## s3.uploadFile

```js
const rise = require('rise-aws-foundation')
await rise.s3.uploadFile({
    file: myBinaryFile,
    bucket: 'my-test-bucket',
    key: '/pics/mypic.jpg'
})
```

## s3.getFile

```js
const rise = require('rise-aws-foundation')
await rise.s3.getFile({
    bucket: 'my-test-bucket',
    key: '/pics/mypic.jpg'
})
```

## s3.removeFile

```js
const rise = require('rise-aws-foundation')
await rise.s3.removeFile({
    bucket: 'my-test-bucket',
    key: '/pics/mypic.jpg'
})
```

## s3.getFileUrl

```js
const rise = require('rise-aws-foundation')
rise.s3.getFileUrl({
    bucket: 'mybucket',
    key: '/one/two.jpg'
})
```

## s3.cf.makeSimpleBucket

```js
const rise = require('rise-aws-foundation')
const s3 = foundation.s3.cf.makeSimpleBucket('myBucketName')
```

## s3.cf.makeBucket

This bucket has additional permissions and encryption settings. This is good
for storing source files for an application

```js
const rise = require('rise-aws-foundation')
const s3 = foundation.s3.cf.makeBucket('myBucketName')
```
