# AWS Foundation

The aws sdk gives us a lot of power and options. This is a good thing, but can also
be overwhelming. The purpose of this project is to provide a layer on top of the sdk that is:

-   opinionated
-   focused
-   stable

The goal is to change the experience of building with aws. Instead of feeling heavy and complicated, the aim is to make building with aws feel light and simple.

## Installation

You can use aws foundation in your project by npm installing it:

```bash
npm i aws-foundation
```
